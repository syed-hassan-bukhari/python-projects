Palindrome Checker ðŸªž

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a given word or number is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, 121).

How It Works

The user enters a word or number.

The program reverses the input using Python string slicing ([::-1]).

It compares the original value with the reversed value.

It prints whether the input is a palindrome or not.
