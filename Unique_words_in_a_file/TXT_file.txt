Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI systems use algorithms and large amounts of data to simulate human thinking and behavior, allowing computers to process information, adapt to new inputs, and improve over time. Today, AI plays a vital role in various fields such as healthcare, finance, education, robotics, and entertainment. From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced self-driving cars and predictive analytics, AI continues to transform the way we live and work, making technology smarter, faster, and more efficient.
